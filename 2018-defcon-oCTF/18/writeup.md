The hint "Don't enumerate me, bro" suggests `robots.txt`.

Accessing that file, we find very few entries:

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /lol
    Disallow: /admin
    Disallow: /root
    Disallow: /fe735b1aa926c6b5843eb46dee60d009/f1b9a783bd788cd77162147376caa6cc22716de9/flag.txt
    Disallow: /~username
    Disallow: all

One of the paths explicitly mentions `flag.txt`. Hitting that path gives us the flag.
